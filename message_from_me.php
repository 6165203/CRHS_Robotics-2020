		<strong>Hello there!</strong>
		<br>
		You're most likely wondering who on Earth made this site. That would be me, Jacob. I know <i>beauty is in the eye of the beholder</i>
		and all, but personally, I'm very proud of the website my team and I were able to create for the 2020 edition of the CRC Robotics
		competition!
