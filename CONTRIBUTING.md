# Contributing guidelines
Please read carefully before submitting pull requests.

---


If you're here, you're most likely going to end up contributing to the project! It's always great to have some extra help on the website, however it's important to remain organized. This small guide will teach you just a few things that might be unique to this repository.

## Reporting an issue
So you've been working around with the site or simply enjoying it and you found something that didn't really work? Maybe a few colors were out of whack or a button wasn't working. In that case, it's important to go to **Issues**, located in the taskbar above (you can also access it by pressing ```g``` and ```i```). From there, you're gonna see a green button in the top right corner of the panel called "New issue". Click it, and you will be given three template options for the issue report:
 - Bug report;
 - Design issue report;
 - Feature request.

If you've found a technical bug, i.e. an element in the website doesn't work the way it's supposed to or at all, then you'll select "Bug report".

If you've found a design malfunction, i.e. some colors don't match well or a few elements' designs seem out of place, then you'll select "Design issue report".

Alternatively, if you have a cool new feature in mind for a problem, then you'll select "Feature request".

From there, simply fill in the necessary information, and add the necessary extra information, found on the sidebar to the right of the textarea. I recomment you add a few assignees (including yourself) for the issue for people who you think should be notified directly about the issue. Afterwards, add any extra labels (as you see fit), and then select "Submit new issue". Once sent, the issue can be seen by everyone else on the team, however people who were assigned to it will be notified of it directly and will therefore more likely see it first.

## Submitting a pull request
Coded a new element to the website? Fixed that issue you saw before? Then making a pull request is the next thing to do! 
Simply go to the **Code** page, and select "Upload files". Then, you can choose the files you wanna upload, and you can add a name and description of what you changed. After, select the radio button to "Create a **new branch**". This will upload your code and open a new pull request: basically its a way to compare your code and the code already on GitHub and for me to check it out and validate it.

After you've sent out a pull request, it'll show up in the **Pull requests** tab, and I'll be able to make sure it's all good. If there's any issue, then I will comment on it whatever the issue is and close the pull request (meaning your code won't override the code already in the repo).
